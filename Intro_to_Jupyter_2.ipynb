    "One of the most helpful features of Markdown is its ability to include formatted code directly in text. Code blocks can be inserted into text in two ways: inline and block. Inline code elements are wrapped in single starting quote \\` characters (also called backticks). For example, the Markdown \\`print(\"Hello World!\")\\` renders as `print(\"Hello, Medium!\")`. Code blocks can also be placed on a single line with no quote characters by indenting the line with four characters:\n",

Many specific functions or math symbols are prefixed with a backslash character, `\\`. For example, if you're a triogonometry professor who needs to write the LaTeX formula for the lowercase Greek character theta, you would write `$\\theta$`. There are many [helpful resources](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) for learning LaTeX freely available on the internet, and there are tools like [LaTeXit](https://pierre.chachatelier.fr/latexit/latexit-home.php) that can help you create and test LaTeX expressions on your own.\n",

    "## Programming Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I feel that computer programming is a difficult skill to learn without any guidance. When I first started programming in 2014, I was overwhelmed by the glut of freely available information on the internet. Remembering how intellectually impotent I felt back then, here's what I would say to someone who's learning to program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn language-independent concepts before learning to use a particular language.\n",
    "2. Learn what problems a programming language was designed to solve, and how they solved it.\n",
    "3. Figure out what programming paradigm a particular language supports. (Few languages implement a paradigm 100%, but many facilitate programming in multiple paradigms.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color ='red'>Note:</font> Feel free to scroll down to Python Basics if you want to jump right into programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language-Independent Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most basic level, a computer program is comprised of nothing more than data and instructions. When I say data, I mean numbers, characters, strings, Boolean values, etc., and intructions refer to the statements we write that control the program's decision-making process. Syntax concerns itself with how those instructions are formatted, while semantics deals with the logic of the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### High-Level vs. Low-Level\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broad sense, there are two categories of programming languages: low-level and high-level. A low-level language (like C++) resembles the numeric machine language of the computer more than the natural language of humans. A high-level language (like Python) is closer to the level of human-readability. \n",
    "\n",
    "![CodingLanguageLevels.jpeg](attachment:CodingLanguageLevels.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Implementation\n",
    "Interpretation and compilation are the two primary means of implementing a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **compiled** language (like C++), source code is first executed by a compiler, which translates the code into machine language, and that machine language directly controls the CPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In an **interpreted language**, the source code is not directly translated by a compiler. Instead, a different program, called the interpreter, reads and executes the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever heard someone complain about Python being a *slow* language, it's because running interpreted code is slower than running compiled code. With Python, the interpreter must analyze each statement in the program *every* time it's executed and then perform the instructed actions. With C++, the compilation process runs once and the execution time is set. If there's an error in the C++ source code, it won't compile. The same error in a Python program is discovered *while* the program is executing, which can slow the development process considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color ='red'> Note:</font> A compiled language is often considered a low-level language, while an interpreted language is considered high-level. However, we should take care not to conflate levels of program abstraction with the methods of their implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax vs. Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples from the C++ and Python programming languages to illustrate the difference between syntax and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax\n",
    "Below, we have two code segments that produce the same output in their respective enviroments, the numbers 1 through 10 printed vertically. The syntactical difference between the languages should be apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the C++ programming language, we denote a block of a code with curly braces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "# C code\n",
    "for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++)\n",
    " {\n",
    "    # curly braces indicate code block\n",
    "    cout << i << endl;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Python, we denote a block of code with indentation:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    # indentation indicates code block\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although both source code segments produce the same output, they are not executed in the same manner, and that's because each language has a different implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "Type checking is a form of program analysis that verifies something about the data types used in a program. When we talk about data types (or just *types*), we're referring to an attribute of data which informs the compiler or interpreter how it's going to be used in the program. For example, let's take another look at our C++ and Python source code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the C++ code below, **int** is a data type in the C++ language, and we had to declare that the variable **i** was in fact an integer *before* we could assign a number to it. This is because C++ is a **statically**-typed language, where type-checking is done at compile time. In other words, you have declare the data type of a variable before you can use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "# C code\n",
    "for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++)\n",
    " {\n",
    "    cout << i << endl;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now take a look at the Python code.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, we did not have to assign a data type to the variable **i** before using it as an int. This is because Python is a **dynamically**-typed language, where type-checking is performed during interpretation, so you don't have to declare the data type of the variable before it's used. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, type-checking either occurs when a program is compiled (a static check) or interpreted (a dynamic check). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If a particular programming language requires its implementation to strictly adhere to type-checking rules, it's referred to as a **strongly**-typed language. If it doesn't, it's considered a **weakly**-typed language. \n",

    "1. The first character must be a letter or an underscore character.\n",
    "2. Variable and Function names traditionally start with a lowercase letter.\n",

    "4. The identifier cannot be one of the reserved Python keywords, listed in the code block below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it's recommended to avoid using names of objects from common Python libraries, like the string, list, or tuple to minimize name collisions and any resultant confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python identifiers are case sensitive, so `myname` is different than `myName`. One of the easiest ways for software engineers to spot a beginning programmer is through meaningless variable and function names, so be sure to write descriptive identifiers. They're beneficial for code readability and subsequent maintenance, which is why we often write multi-word identifiers. When combining words for an identifier, you can either use camel-case format, where each word *after* the first is capitalized like `myNameSpace`. Alternatively, you can also partition words by using underscores such as `my_name_space`. Regardless of which approach you utilize, it's best to be consistent with your indentifier names.\n",

Python supports two types of comments. The first type of comment is a single-line comment, which begins with a hashtag `#` and continues until the end of the line. (The `#` character can appear anywhere on the line.) Here's an example of single line comments - the first consists of the whole line, while the second starts after the command:\n",

This comment can span multiple lines, which is why it's used in programs to provide documentation via implicit docstrings for functions and classes. Here's an example of a multi-line comment string:\n",

    "## Python Modules & Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The more popular a programming language or web application framework becomes, the more individuals and organizations invest time and money into developing applications for them. Thanks to [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), Python supports encapsulating code into [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), which are just files consisting of definitions for functions, classes, or variables.*Modules* can be imported into other Python files, which means these definitions can be reused. (Code reusability is essential to good software engineering.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know what happens when modules get really popular? They're bundled into a Python **package**. Importing packages (or modules) into other Python programs is as simple as using the `import` statement, which takes multiple forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import numpy`\n",
    "2. `import numpy as np`\n",
    "3. `from numpy import linspace`\n",
    "4. `from numpy import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first import statement pulls everything from the numpy package into the current program, but leaves all items in the numpy [namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace#:~:text=A%20namespace%20in%20computer%20science,associated%20only%20with%20that%20namespace.). This means if you want to refer to a particular definition, like `linspace`, you have to use the `numpy` prefix, as in `numpy.linspace()`. The second import statement is similar to the first, but the prefix has been shortened to `np`. The third import statement only imports the single definition which is also brought into the current namespace, which means it doesn't require a prefix. The last import statement pulls the entire contents of the _numpy_ package into the current file and namespace. Unfortunately, this increases the chances for name collisions, so perhaps it might be best to avoid this particular import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many popular packages have been included with the standard Python distributions and are known collectively as the Standard Library. Other packages are available from third parties, yet can be very useful in specific circumstances. Here are some of the more popular Python packages for data science:\n",
    "\n",

    "- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (Fast numerical arrays and matrices)\n",

    "There are many more amazing packages for the Python ecosystem, so be sure to check out [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), the official repository for public Python packages. These libraries can usually be installed with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), the Python package management tool. Unfortunately, pip is beyond the scope of this tutorial. \n",
